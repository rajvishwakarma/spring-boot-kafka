The is sample application built with spring-boot to demonstrate Kafka with Avro for schema-registry.
Also we have used cassandra as DB. 

A. user-service
B. notificaiton-service

On user-service the user is registered in cassandra database(POST request to save user data) and the user-data is publish on 
kafka. The published data is then subscribed by the notification-service. Eventually notification-service saves the details 
in cassandra DB again marking that the welcome mail has been sent to the use as a notification. We have not used the mailing
service here.
